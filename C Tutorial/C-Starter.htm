<P>This tutorial teaches the entire C programming language. It is composed
of 13 chapters which should be studied in order since topics are introduced
in a logical order and build upon topics introduced in previous chapters.
It is to the students benefit to download the source code for the example
programs, then compile and execute each program as it is studied. The diligent
student will modify the example program in some way, then recompile and
execute it to see if he understands the material studied for that program.
This will provide the student with valuable experience using his compiler.

<P>The recommended method of study is to print the text for one or two
chapters, download the example programs, and study the material by loading
the example programs in the compiler's editor for viewing. Following successful
completion of each chapter, additional chapters can be downloaded as progress
is made.

<P>This tutorial is distributed as shareware which means that you do not
have to pay to use it. However, the author spent a good deal of time and
financial resources to develop this tutorial and requests that you share
in the financial burden in a very small way, but only if you felt the tutorial
was valuable to you as an aid in learning to program in C. If you wish
to remit a small payment to the author, full instructions for doing so
will be given by clicking the link below. If you do not wish to remit any
payment, please feel free to use the tutorial anyway. In either case, I
hope you find programming in C to be rewarding and profitable. I personally
think it is an excellent language.
