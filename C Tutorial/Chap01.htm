<B>C Tutorial - Chapter 1</B>

<P><B>WHAT IS AN IDENTIFIER?</B>

<P>Before you can do anything in any language, you must know how to name
an identifier. An identifier is used for any variable, function, data definition,
etc. In the C programming language, an identifier is a combination of alphanumeric
characters, the first being a letter of the alphabet or an underline, and
the remaining being any letter of the alphabet, any numeric digit, or the
underline.

<P>Two rules must be kept in mind when naming identifiers.
<OL>
<LI>
The case of alphabetic characters is significant. Using <B>INDEX </B>for
a variable name is not the same as using <B>index</B> and neither of them
is the same as using <B>InDeX</B> for a variable name. All three refer
to different variables.</LI>

<LI>
According to the ANSI-C standard, at least 31 significant characters can
be used and will be considered significant by a conforming ANSI-C compiler.
If more than 31 are used, all characters beyond the 31st may be ignored
by any given compiler.</LI>
</OL>
<B>WHAT ABOUT THE UNDERLINE?</B>

<P>The underline can be used as part of a variable name, and adds greatly
to the readability of the resulting code. It is used by some, but not all,
experienced C programmers. A few underlines are used for illustration in
this tutorial. Since most compiler writers use the underline as the first
character for variable names internal to the system, you should refrain
from using the underline to begin an identifier to avoid the possibility
of a name clash. To get specific, identifiers with two leading underscores
are reserved for the compiler as well as identifiers beginning with a single
underscore and using an upper case alphabetic character for the second.
If you make it a point of style to never use an identifier with a leading
underline, you will not have a naming clash with the system.

<P>It adds greatly to the readability of a program to use descriptive names
for variables and it would be to your advantage to do so. Pascal and Ada
programmers tend to use long descriptive names, but most C programmers
tend to use short cryptic names. Most of the example programs in this tutorial
use very short names for that reason, but a few longer names are used for
illustrative purposes.

<P><B>KEYWORDS</B>

<P>There are 32 words defined as keywords in C. These have predefined uses
and cannot be used for any other purpose in a C program. They are used
by the compiler as an aid to compiling the program. They are always written
in lower case. A complete list follows;
<PRE><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; auto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; double&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; switch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; case&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; register&nbsp;&nbsp; typedef
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; union
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; const&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; float&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; short&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue&nbsp;&nbsp; for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sizeof&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; volatile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while</B></PRE>
In addition to this list of keywords, your compiler may define a few more.
If it does, they will be listed in the documentation that came with your
compiler. Each of the above keywords will be defined, illustrated, and
used in this tutorial.

<P><B>WE NEED DATA AND A PROGRAM</B>

<P>Any computer program has two entities to consider, the data, and the
program. They are highly dependent on one another and careful planning
of both will lead to a well planned and well written program. Unfortunately,
it is not possible to study either completely without a good working knowledge
of the other. For that reason, this tutorial will jump back and forth between
teaching methods of program writing and methods of data definition. Simply
follow along and you will have a good understanding of both. Keep in mind
that, even though it seems expedient to sometimes jump right into coding
the program, time spent planning the data structures will be well spent
and the quality of the final program will reflect the original planning.

<P><B>HOW THIS TUTORIAL IS WRITTEN</B>

<P>As you go through the example programs, you will find that every program
is complete. There are no program fragments that could be confusing. This
allows you to see every requirement that is needed to use any of the features
of C as they are presented. Some tutorials I have seen give very few, and
very complex examples. They really serve more to confuse the student. This
tutorial is the complete opposite because it strives to cover each new
aspect of programming in as simple a context as possible. This method,
however, leads to a lack of knowledge in how the various parts are combined.
For that reason, chapter 14 is devoted entirely to using the features taught
in the earlier chapters. It will illustrate how to put the various features
together to create a usable program. They are given for your study, and
are not completely explained. Enough details of their operation are given
to allow you to understand how they work after you have completed all of
the previous lessons.

<P>Throughout this tutorial, <B>keywords, variable names,</B> and <B>function
names</B> will be given in boldface as an aid to clarity. These terms will
be completely defined throughout the tutorial.

<P><B>RESULT OF EXECUTION</B>

<P>The result of executing each program will be given in comments at the
end of the program listing after the comment is defined in about the fourth
program of chapter 2. If you feel confident that you completely understand
the program, you can simply refer to the result of execution to see if
you understand the result. In this case, it will not be necessary for you
to compile and execute every program. It would be a good exercise for you
to compile and execute some of them however, because all C compilers will
not generate exactly the same results and you need to get familiar with
your own compiler.

<P>Example program ------> <B>FIRSTEX.C</B>

<P>At this point, you should compile and execute FIRSTEX.C if you have
not yet done so, to see that your C compiler is properly loaded and operating.
Don't worry about what the program does yet. In due time you will understand
it completely.

<P>Note that this program will compile and execute properly with any good
compiler.

<P><B>A WORD ABOUT COMPILERS</B>

<P>All of the example programs in this tutorial will compile and execute
correctly with any good ANSI compatible C compiler. Some compilers have
gotten extremely complex and hard to use for a beginning C programmer,
and some only compile and build Microsoft Windows programs. Fortunately,
most of the C compilers available have a means of compiling a standard
C program which is written for the DOS environment and includes none of
the Windows extensions. You should check your documentation for the capabilities
and limitations of your compiler. If you have not yet purchased a C compiler,
you should find one that is ANSI-C compliant, and that also has the ability
to generate a DOS executable if you are planning to use the DOS operating
system.

<P><B>ANSWERS TO PROGRAMMING EXERCISES</B>

<P>There are programming exercises at the end of most of the chapters.
You should attempt to do original work on each of the exercises before
referring to the answers (all of which are zipped into cans.zip) in order
to gain your own programming experience. These answers are given for your
information in case you are completely stuck on how to solve a particular
problem. These answers are not meant to be the only answer, since there
are many ways to program anything, but they are meant to illustrate one
way to solve the suggested programming problem.

<P>The answers are all in source files named in the format CHnn_m.C where
nn is the chapter number, and m is the exercise number. If more than one
answer is required, an A, B, or C is included following the exercise number.
