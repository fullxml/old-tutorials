<p>If you are satisfied with the quality of the tutorial(s) which you are
interested in, you can submit a registration fee to help defray the cost
of developing the tutorial and to provide funds for developing additional
tutorials or programming information. There is no fixed fee for using one
or more tutorials, so you should consider the following amounts as suggested
fees. You can pay whatever you think the information is worth.</p>

<p>Registration Fee for any single tutorial - $15.00 suggested.</p>

<p>Registration Fee to cover all tutorials - $25.00 suggested.</p>

<p>Registration Fee for educational institutions - One half of the above
amounts. (please register as a group with a single payment if possible
to reduce paperwork.)</p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>METHOD OF&nbsp;PAYMENT</font></b></p>

<p><a href="paymve.html">Method 1 - Mastercard or Visa via email.</a></p>

<p><a href="paymvp.html">Method 2 - Mastercard or Visa via Post Office</a></p>

<p><a href="payckp.html">Method 3 - Check or Money Order via Post Office</a></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE FOR REGISTERING</font></b></p>

<p>You will receive a hardcopy receipt and a thank you if you send a postal
address, and an email receipt and a thank you if you only provide an email
address. There is really nothing additional to offer you since all of the
tutorials are available for downloading in their entirity from this Web
site. There is no &quot;crippleware&quot; within this web site, nor will
there ever be.</p>

<p>Crippleware is limited capability software for which a payment is required
to get the full version.</p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in our tutorials and for visiting our Web
site.</p>
