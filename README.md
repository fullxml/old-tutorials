# Old C/C++ Tutorials

Around 1999 I was introduced to the Internet. Dailup was the way to access it and so I did. I was facinated by the information available online. To save me from waiting again and again for the dialup and to save some $$$ on the bandwidth I usually downloaded files for later read. These files are result of that. Seems like these files are no more available online. Now in 2025, there are better books and resources available but to have things from old times files are uploaded here for everyone to use in case if it interests you.
