<h4>Subject</h4>
	This is the home page for the maintainer of the Oracle FAQ Web Pages
	and contains jump points to the FAQ and the related FTP archive area.
	<strong>Parts of this FAQ are currently under major revision and
	will appear RSN at a new address to be announced.  The revisions
	are not currently visible from this site.  If anyone has comments
	email me here.  BTW - My home address (physical) will be changing
	to.  Busy Busy</strong>
	<br>
<h4>Intended Audience</h4>
	Anyone using, or thinking about using, the Oracle Relational Database
	Management System or related tools.
	<br>

<h2>Major Jump Points</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="contents.html"><strong>Contents page
			of the Oracle FAQ</strong></a>
			<br>This is where you probably want to go if you have got this
			far, have a reasonable connection, and want to be able to
			follow links to other machines or the archive site.
		</li>
		<li><a href="ftp://ftp.bf.rmit.edu.au/pub/Oracle/FAQ/orafaqwww.zip"><strong>Gets
			all the pages in one hit<strong></a>
			<br>All the local pages (which use relative links to each other
			rather than absolute ones, so they should work on your local
			machine except for links to other sites or ftp archive area)
			are zipped up into one file.  Good if you have limited access
			to the Net or if you find the link here to Oz is slow.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Mirrors of these Pages</strong>
			<br>You might find it easier to reference a local mirror of
			these pages.  Some will have just the pages, some will have
			some of the FTP archive.  Here they are:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Unknown as yet</strong>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><a href="ftp://ftp.bf.rmit.edu.au/pub/Oracle/"><strong>FTP
			archive area</strong></a>
			<br>The FTP archives associated with these pages are at
			<strong>ftp://ftp.bf.rmit.edu.au/pub/Oracle</strong>.  This
			is useful to browse.  It contains utilities, demons and a
			couple of things from www.oracle.com.
			<br><br>The tools directly
			from Oracle under pub/Oracle/Sites/Oracle should
			<strong>NOT</strong> be accessed if you are restricted from
			doing so under U.S. laws, or if you want to be guaranteed the
			latest versions.  They are put here mainly for Australians
			to avoid overloading the links to the US.
			<br><br>A (hopefully recent) list of the contents of the
			archive (without descriptions) that contains hot spots linking
			to the various files is in
			<a href="ftp.html">FTP archive list page</a>.
		</li>
		<li><strong>Oracle Corporation Links</strong>
			<br>These are not authorized by the author of the Oracle FAQ
			pages <strong><code>;-)</code></strong>.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Web Pages</a>
					<br>A guided tour through Oracle's products, with
					news, FAQ, etc.
				</li>
				<li><a href="ftp://ftp.oracle.com/">FTP Site</a>
					<br>If you do not like constantly renegotiating a
					connection, use FTP and go to
					<strong>ftp://ftp.oracle.com</strong>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Author's Home Page</strong>

			of David T. Bath, the author of these FAQ pages, go to
