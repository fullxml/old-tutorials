<P>This tutorial teaches the C++ programming language but assumes that
the student has already attained a reasonable proficiency in C programming.
It is composed of 12 chapters which should be studied in order since topics
are introduced in a logical order and build upon topics introduced in previous
chapters. It is to the students benefit to download the source code for
the example programs, then compile and execute each program as it is studied.
The diligent student will modify the example program in some way, then
recompile and execute it to see if he understands the material studied
for that program. This will provide the student with valuable experience
using his compiler.

<P>The recommended method of study is to print the text for one or two
chapters, download the example programs, and study the material by loading
the example programs in the compiler's editor for viewing. Following successful
completion of each chapter, additional chapters can be downloaded.

<P>This tutorial is distributed as shareware which means that you do not
have to pay to use it. However, the author spent a good deal of time and
financial resources to develop this tutorial and requests that you share
in the financial burden in a very small way, but only if you felt the tutorial
was valuable to you as an aid in learning to program in C++. If you wish
to remit a small payment to the author, full instructions for doing so
will be given by clicking the link below. If you do not wish to remit any
payment, please feel free to use the tutorial anyway. In either case, I
hope you find programming in C++ to be rewarding and profitable. I personally
think it is an excellent extension to C programming and is well worth the
effort needed to master it.
